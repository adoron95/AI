Exercise n puzzle:

1. Change the heuristic function so that it returns the number of tiles that are out of place.
Run search (3) and search (4) with the heuristics, and write software that will emit the maximum depth and number of tests (items) on average from 100 runs of searches in 3X3 and 4X4 puzzles. The output can be for search (3):
Average depth 1.83
Average items 6.39

3. Change the heuristic function so that it returns the sum of the Manhattan distances of the tiles from their position in the target position. To check that both functions work, run each of the heuristics for the following board instead of a random board:

s = [[4, 3, 7, 5, 8, 6, 1, 0, 2], '']

What is the output for the two heuristics?

4. Run search (3) and search (4) with the heuristics, and write software that will emit the maximum depth and number of tests (items) on average from 100 runs of searches in 3X3 and 4X4 puzzles. The output can be for search (3):
Average depth 1.83
Average items 6.39
